Conversation-Processing
=======================

An app to reprocess and recombine conversations:

* Enable conversations to grow into something more comprehensive
* Transition from unstructured to structured (http://www.communitywiki.org/en/StructureOfWikis) and reprocess the history into a structure.
* Dispatching content to where it can be processed (mind map, document, project management)
* Processing of content and iteration, annotation, evaluation, modification (sandbox)
* Hands on modifying and scaling â€“ fork, diff, merge. (re: open source - github)

Think dicussions on FB or LI. How to turn them into projects.

Maybe using trello 'card' type of tool + [zapier](https://zapier.com/) type of integration app... 

There's http://anthologize.org/ that offers something like that for blog posts. Would be great to extend that to every piece of user generated content on a WP site!

I've shared some ideas a while ago on github (a bit wordy :) : https://github.com/HeleneFi/The_Project/blob/master/Conversation.to.Action-Pull.Platform.md
